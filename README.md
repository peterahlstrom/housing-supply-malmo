# housing-supply-malmo
A CRUD application made with React for the city of Malm√∂, to be used for the City Planning Office in their work with housing supply planning.

Uploaded mainly to make it accessible for my collaborating colleagues. This is not an out-of-the-box thing, but if bits of it is useful for you I'm of course happy.
The application depends on a fork of [react-bootstrap-table](https://github.com/peterahlstrom/react-bootstrap-table) by [@AllenFang](https://github.com/AllenFang). The fork is made mostly for customizing label to the language (swedish) talked by the intended users.

The communication with the database is done through Python cgi-scripts running on an Apache server. These are found in the ws-folder.
